Recent work with such query variations has demonstrated that different queries can fetch notably divergent sets of documents, even when the queries have identical intents and superficial similarity. That is, different users might receive SERPs of quite different effectiveness for the same information need. That observation then raises an interesting question: do users have a sense of how useful any given query will be? Can they anticipate the effectiveness of alternative queries for the same retrieval need? To explore that question we designed and carried out a crowd-sourced user study in which we asked subjects to consider an information need statement expressed as a backstory, and then provide their opinions as to the relative usefulness of a set of queries ostensibly addressing that objective. We solicited opinions using two different interfaces: one that collected absolute ratings of queries, and one that required that the subjects place a set of queries into ``order''. We found that crowd workers are reasonably consistent in their estimates of how effective queries are likely to be, and also that their estimates correlate positively with actual system performance.","tags":["\"Query variations; query performance prediction\""],"title":"Can Users Predict Relative Query Effectiveness?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Guglielmo Faggioli","Oleg Zendel","J.

Recent work showed that the problem can be significantly harder when multiple queries representing the same information need are used in prediction. By generalizing the existing evaluation framework of Query Performance Prediction (QPP) we explore the causes of these differences in prediction quality in the two scenarios. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that for most predictors, this difference is solely an artifact of the underlying differences in the query effectiveness distributions. Our detailed analysis also demonstrates key performance distribution properties under which QPP is most and least reliable.","tags":["\"Query Performance Prediction\"","\"Evaluation\"","\"Query Variations\""],"title":"Is Query Performance Prediction With Multiple Query Variations Harder Than Topic Performance Prediction?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Oleg Zendel"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1620604800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1620604800,"objectID":"60904761d8f2406f748732bac785b5b3","permalink":"https://zendelo.github.io/publication/dcsigir/","publishdate":"2021-05-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dcsigir/","section":"publication","summary":"The research on Query Performance Prediction (QPP) focuses on estimating the effectiveness of retrieval results in the absence of human relevance judgments. Accurately estimating the result of a search performed in response to a query has been extensively studied over the past two decades. With the rising popularity of virtual assistants along with evolving research on complex informa- tion needs, the need for reliable QPP methods as well as the number of potential applications significantly increases. In this work, we focus on improving the evaluation framework of QPP. As we see the existing evaluation as a considerable limitation in the improvement of QPP methods, a reliable and improved evaluation framework would constitute a stepping-stone for a breakthrough in QPP. The existing evaluation framework in QPP mainly relies on the measurement of the correlation coefficient between the per-query prediction scores and the actual per-query system effectiveness measure, usually Average Precision (AP). The QPP method that achieves higher correlation is considered to be superior. However, Hauff et al. demonstrate that higher correlation does not vouch for more accurate prediction. The authors additionally advocate the usage of Fisher‚Äôs ùëß transformation and Confidence Intervals (CIs) to determine statistically significant differences between multiple correlation coefficients. Furthermore, the existing evaluation methodology is true only per a specific combination of a corpus, retrieval method, and set of queries; and does not necessarily hold if any of these is changed. That is, the existing evaluation is not agnostic to the different components, thus any conclusions about the relative prediction quality of the QPP methods should be taken with a grain of salt.

Although closing ads requires additional user engagement and usually indicates a poor user experience, ad closes are not as scarce as one might expect. Recently it was shown that penalizing ads with high closing likelihood during auctions may substantially reduce the number of ad closes while maintaining a small predefined revenue loss. In this work, we focus on email since this is the property in which most ad closes occur. Using data collected from a major email provider, we present interesting insights about the interplay between ad closes in email and email-related user actions. In particular, we explore the merits of integrating information derived from user actions in email for ad-close prediction. Thorough performance evaluation reveals that incorporating such signals significantly improves ad-close prediction quality over previously reported results.","tags":[],"title":"Leveraging User Email Actions to Improve Ad-Close Prediction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Oleg Zendel","Anna Shtok","Fiana Raiber","Oren Kurland","J.

Existing QPP methods do not account for the effectiveness of a query in representing the underlying information need. We demonstrate the far-reaching implications of this reality using standard TREC-based evaluation of QPP methods: their relative prediction quality patterns vary with respect to the effectiveness of queries used to represent the information needs. Motivated by our findings, we revise the basic probabilistic formulation of the QPP task by accounting for the information need and its connection to the query. We further explore this connection by proposing a novel QPP approach that utilizes information about a set of queries representing the same information need. Predictors instantiated from our approach using a wide variety of existing QPP methods post prediction quality that substantially transcends that of applying these methods, as is standard, using a single query representing the information need. Additional in-depth empirical analysis of different aspects of our approach further attests to the crucial role of query effectiveness in QPP.","tags":[],"title":"Information Needs, Queries, and Query Performance Prediction","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://zendelo.github.io/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
