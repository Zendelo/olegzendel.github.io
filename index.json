Recent work showed that the problem can be significantly harder when multiple queries representing the same information need are used in predic- tion. By generalizing the existing evaluation framework of Query Performance Prediction (QPP) we explore the causes of these differ- ences in prediction quality in the two scenarios. Our empirical analy- sis demonstrates that for most predictors, this difference is solely an artifact of the underlying differences in the query effectiveness dis- tributions. Our detailed analysis also demonstrates key performance distribution properties under which QPP is most and least reliable.","tags":["\"Query Performance Prediction\"","\"Evaluation\"","\"Query Variations\""],"title":"Is Query Performance Prediction With Multiple Query Variations Harder Than Topic Performance Prediction?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Oleg Zendel"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1620604800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1620604800,"objectID":"60904761d8f2406f748732bac785b5b3","permalink":"./publication/dcsigir/","publishdate":"2021-05-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"publication/dcsigir/","section":"publication","summary":"The research on Query Performance Prediction (QPP) focuses on estimating the effectiveness of retrieval results in the absence of human relevance judgments. Accurately estimating the result of a search performed in response to a query has been extensively studied over the past two decades. With the rising popularity of virtual assistants along with evolving research on complex informa- tion needs, the need for reliable QPP methods as well as the number of potential applications significantly increases. In this work, we focus on improving the evaluation framework of QPP. As we see the existing evaluation as a considerable limitation in the improvement of QPP methods, a reliable and improved evaluation framework would constitute a stepping-stone for a breakthrough in QPP. The existing evaluation framework in QPP mainly relies on the measurement of the correlation coefficient between the per-query prediction scores and the actual per-query system effectiveness measure, usually Average Precision (AP). The QPP method that achieves higher correlation is considered to be superior. However, Hauff et al. demonstrate that higher correlation does not vouch for more accurate prediction. The authors additionally advocate the usage of Fisher‚Äôs ùëß transformation and Confidence Intervals (CIs) to determine statistically significant differences between multiple correlation coefficients. Furthermore, the existing evaluation methodology is true only per a specific combination of a corpus, retrieval method, and set of queries; and does not necessarily hold if any of these is changed. That is, the existing evaluation is not agnostic to the different components, thus any conclusions about the relative prediction quality of the QPP methods should be taken with a grain of salt.

A by-product of this research is a methodology to evaluate the effectiveness of QPP techniques. In this paper, we re-examine the existing evaluation methodology commonly used for QPP, and propose a new approach. Our key idea is to model QPP performance as a distribution instead of relying on point estimates. Our work demonstrates important statistical implications, and overcomes key limitations imposed by the currently used correlation-based point-estimate evaluation approaches. We also explore the potential benefits of using multiple query formulations and ANalysis Of VAriance (ANOVA) modeling in order to measure interactions between multiple factors. The resulting statistical analysis combined with a novel evaluation framework demonstrates the merits of modeling QPP performance as distributions, and enables detailed statistical ANOVA models for comparative analyses to be created.","tags":[],"title":"An Enhanced Evaluation Framework for Query Performance Prediction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Oleg Zendel","Yaroslav Fyodorov","Fiana Raiber","Natalia Silberstein","Oren Somekh","Ali Tabaja"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1601510400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601510400,"objectID":"d6bac7ea3431fd89d3719ff1c61a5489","permalink":"./publication/adclosepred/","publishdate":"2020-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"publication/adclosepred/","section":"publication","summary":"Online advertising systems often provide means for users to close ads and also leave feedback. Although closing ads requires additional user engagement and usually indicates a poor user experience, ad closes are not as scarce as one might expect. Recently it was shown that penalizing ads with high closing likelihood during auctions may substantially reduce the number of ad closes while maintaining a small predefined revenue loss. In this work, we focus on email since this is the property in which most ad closes occur. Using data collected from a major email provider, we present interesting insights about the interplay between ad closes in email and email-related user actions. In particular, we explore the merits of integrating information derived from user actions in email for ad-close prediction. Thorough performance evaluation reveals that incorporating such signals significantly improves ad-close prediction quality over previously reported results.","tags":[],"title":"Leveraging User Email Actions to Improve Ad-Close Prediction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Oleg Zendel","Anna Shtok","Fiana Raiber","Oren Kurland","J.

Existing QPP methods do not account for the effectiveness of a query in representing the underlying information need. We demonstrate the far-reaching implications of this reality using standard TREC-based evaluation of QPP methods: their relative prediction quality patterns vary with respect to the effectiveness of queries used to represent the information needs. Motivated by our findings, we revise the basic probabilistic formulation of the QPP task by accounting for the information need and its connection to the query. We further explore this connection by proposing a novel QPP approach that utilizes information about a set of queries representing the same information need. Predictors instantiated from our approach using a wide variety of existing QPP methods post prediction quality that substantially transcends that of applying these methods, as is standard, using a single query representing the information need. Additional in-depth empirical analysis of different aspects of our approach further attests to the crucial role of query effectiveness in QPP.","tags":[],"title":"Information Needs, Queries, and Query Performance Prediction","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?
