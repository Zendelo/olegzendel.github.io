Greetings! I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate in computer science at RMIT University, Melbourne, Australia, under the esteemed guidance of Profs. J. Shane Culpepper and Falk Scholer.
My research journey centers on Query Performance Prediction (QPP) in Information Retrieval (IR), where I'm dedicated to exploring various aspects of QPP to improve its understanding and evaluation.
Aside from QPP, I'm intrigued by end-to-end search pipelines and user behavior analysis, seeking ways to make them more effective and user-friendly.
Empirical experimentation, statistical analysis, and machine learning models are my tools of choice to delve deeper into these areas.

During my M.Sc. at Technion -- Israel Institute of Technology, supervised by Prof. Oren Kurland, I explored ways to improve QPP using reference queries.

Beyond academics, I find joy in hiking, biking, and spending time with my family and our beloved dog, Quan.
As a volunteer with Guide Dogs Victoria, I've been both a puppy raiser and a temporary carer, contributing to a cause close to my heart.

If you share an interest in the fascinating world of Information Retrieval or would like to collaborate on research in IR, feel free to reach out to me via email or social media.
I'm always eager to explore exciting opportunities for collaboration and knowledge exchange.
