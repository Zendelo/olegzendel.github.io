abstract: "Any given information need can be expressed via a wide range of possible\
\ queries. Recent work with such query variations has demonstrated that different\
\ queries can fetch notably divergent sets of documents, even when the queries have\
\ identical intents and superficial similarity. That is, different users might receive\
\ SERPs of quite different effectiveness for the same information need. That observation\
\ then raises an interesting question: do users have a sense of how useful any given\
\ query will be? Can they anticipate the effectiveness of alternative queries for\
\ the same retrieval need? To explore that question we designed and carried out\
\ a crowd-sourced user study in which we asked subjects to consider an information\
\ need statement expressed as a backstory, and then provide their opinions as to\
\ the relative usefulness of a set of queries ostensibly addressing that objective.\
\ We solicited opinions using two different interfaces: one that collected absolute\
\ ratings of queries, and one that required that the subjects place a set of queries\
\ into ``order''. We found that crowd workers are reasonably consistent in their\
\ estimates of how effective queries are likely to be, and also that their estimates\
\ correlate positively with actual system performance."
