abstract: Query performance prediction (QPP) has been studied extensively in the IR
  community over the last two decades. A by-product of this research is a methodology
  to evaluate the effectiveness of QPP techniques. In this paper, we re-examine the
  existing evaluation methodology commonly used for QPP, and propose a new approach.
  Our key idea is to model QPP performance as a distribution instead of relying on
  point estimates. To obtain such distribution, we exploit the scaled Absolute Ranking
  Error (sARE) measure, and its mean the scaled Mean Absolute Ranking Error (sMARE).
  Our work demonstrates important statistical implications, and overcomes key limitations
  imposed by the currently used correlation-based point-estimate evaluation approaches.
  We also explore the potential benefits of using multiple query formulations and
  ANalysis Of VAriance (ANOVA) modeling in order to measure interactions between multiple
  factors. The resulting statistical analysis combined with a novel evaluation framework
  demonstrates the merits of modeling QPP performance as distributions, and enables
  detailed statistical ANOVA models for comparative analyses to be created.
