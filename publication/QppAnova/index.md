abstract: Query Performance Prediction (QPP) has been studied extensively in the IR
  community over the last two decades. A by-product of this research is a methodology
  to evaluate the effectiveness of QPP techniques. In this paper, we re-examine the
  existing evaluation methodology commonly used for QPP, and propose a new approach.
  Our key idea is to model QPP performance as a distribution instead of relying on
  point estimates. Our work demonstrates important statistical implications, and overcomes
  key limitations imposed by the currently used correlation-based point-estimate evaluation
  approaches. We also explore the potential benefits of using multiple query formulations
  and ANalysis Of VAriance (ANOVA) modeling in order to measure interactions between
  multiple factors. The resulting statistical analysis combined with a novel evaluation
  framework demonstrates the merits of modeling QPP performance as distributions,
  and enables detailed statistical ANOVA models for comparative analyses to be created.
