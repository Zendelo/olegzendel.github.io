abstract: 'Accurately estimating the retrieval effectiveness of different
 queries representing distinct information needs is a problem in Information Retrieval
 (IR) that has been studied for over 20 years. Recent work showed that the problem can
 be significantly harder when multiple queries representing the same information need
 are used in prediction. By generalizing the existing evaluation framework of Query
 Performance Prediction (QPP) we explore the causes of these differences in prediction
 quality in the two scenarios. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that for most predictors,
 this difference is solely an artifact of the underlying differences in the query effectiveness
 distributions. Our detailed analysis also demonstrates key performance distribution properties
 under which QPP is most and least reliable.'
