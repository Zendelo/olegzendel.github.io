abstract: "Large language models (LLMs) are capable of assessing document and query
    characteristics, including relevance, and are now being used for a variety
    of different classification labeling tasks as well. This study explores how
    to use LLMs to classify an *information need*, often represented as a
    user query. In particular, our goal is to classify the cognitive complexity
    of the search task for a  given ``backstory''. Using 180 TREC topics and
    backstories, we show that GPT-based LLMs agree with human experts as much as
    other human experts. We also show that batching and ordering can
    significantly impact the accuracy of GPT-3.5, but rarely alter the quality
    of GPT-4 predictions. This study provides insights into the efficacy of
    large language models for annotation tasks normally completed by humans, and
    offers recommendations for other similar applications.
